GAI lab test Atom creator.

This project creates "realistic" atom simulations using unity.

The Nucleus is scaled based on the number of electrons.
The Electrons are set to space away from the nucleus based on the radius of it and their shell.
The Electrons speed is based on their distance from the nucleus, the further from it the faster they move.
The Shells have a limit on how many electrons can be placed on each one however they will not forcibly removed as this simulation allows for any atoms creation

To create new Atoms, simply create a new gameobject, add the Atom creator script and fil in the available values.
